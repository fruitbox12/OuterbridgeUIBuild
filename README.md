This project host the latest Outerbridge React build folder.

This is for cases where `yarn build` on [Outerbridge](https://github.com/Outerbridgeio/Outerbridge) takes too long to finish. As a workaround, the `build` folder from this repo can be used to skip the `yarn build`.

Details of how to use this can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/HenryHengZJ/f8fb7dae0300d18a104cc4a29ec51a7a)
